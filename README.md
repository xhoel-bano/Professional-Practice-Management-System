# Professional-Practice-Management-System
### - by Bit7
It is created with a focus on students and the first steps to building their careers. Professional Practice Management System (PPMS) is thought to be a middle tool that builds bridges between Universities and Businesses. The main actors of this system will be students which would have the opportunity to create their profiles, market themselves, and deep dive into hundreds of possibilities from different businesses and fields, by having the chance to find an internship and create their first contact with professionals. 
Moreover, as Professional Practice stands as a compulsory course in many universities & degrees in Albania and the procedure is done manually, we build PPMS as a unique solution in the Albanian market that not only will save time by automating the procedure and by increasing the reliability of paperwork, but also environmental friendly as it will automate the process by reducing tons of paper used by students to report their daily diary. Even after graduation PPMS will serve as a Job-Hub, where Businesses can advertise their vacancies for young graduated professionals.
